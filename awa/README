Ada Web Application

Ada Web Application is a framework to build a Web Application in Ada 2005.

To build AWA, you will need:

 - Ada Util     (https://github.com/stcarrez/ada-util             1.7.0)
 - Ada EL       (https://github.com/stcarrez/ada-el               1.5.0)
 - Ada Security (https://github.com/stcarrez/ada-security         1.1.0)
 - ADO          (https://github.com/stcarrez/ada-ado              1.0.0)
 - ASF          (https://github.com/stcarrez/ada-asf              1.0.0)
 - AWS          (http://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/aws/     2.11)
 - XML/Ada      (http://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/xmlada/  4.3)

Build
  Build with the following commands:

    ./configure
    make


Samples
  The samples provided in AWA is in fact a complete application
  created by Dynamo.  It can be built using:

    cd samples
    ./configure
    make

Database Creation (MySQL)

   Create the tests database by using the Dynamo command.
   (Dynamo is available at: https://github.com/stcarrez/ada-gen/)
       Note: change 'root' and 'password' to a MySQL user that has admin access rights
             ('create database' and 'grant option' privileges).

    dynamo create-database db root password

   The default database connection string is defined in dynamo.xml.
   To create manually the database, you can proceed to the following steps:

    1. Create the 'awa_test' database in MySQL

         mysql -u root
         mysql> create database awa_test;

    2. Create the 'awa_user' user and give the access rights:

         mysql> grant select, insert, update, delete,
                      create, drop, create temporary tables, execute,
                      show view on `awa_test`.* to awa_user@'localhost';
         mysql> flush privileges;

    3. Create the tables

         mysql> use awa_test
         mysql> source db/mysql/create-awa-mysql.sql

Tests
  The unit tests are built using:

    gnatmake -Ptests


  And unit tests are executed with:

    bin/awa_harness -config test-mysql.properties
  or
    bin/awa_harness -config test-sqlite.properties
